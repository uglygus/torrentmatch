## torrentmatch

compares a folder of torrents to a folder of media. Finds 
torrents that are missing media files and finds media files 
that do not belong to any torrents.


This is particularly useful to find old/unneeded files in an Torrent
directory that aren't served by any loaded torrents any more.

    $ torrentmatch  torrent-dir media-dir
