## torrentmatch

Compares a folder of torrents to a folder of media. Finds torrents that are missing media files and finds media files that do not belong to any torrents.

This is particularly useful for finding old or unneeded files in a torrent directory that aren't served by any loaded torrents anymore.

### Usage

```bash
$ torrentmatch torrent-dir media-dir
